# Zoomcamp Date Engineer Course Script to load and clean required files to GC storage

## The original script was from here:

https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_3_data_warehouse/extras

This script has been modified to clean up the data types and rename the fields to lowercase before uploading them as parquet files.
